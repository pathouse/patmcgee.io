## Fresh Start

<!-- begin summary -->

New website, new blog. I've done this countless times, each time I claim that I am
sticking with it. That this is it. Well, I think this time I may actually be able
to fulfill that promise. We'll see.

Looking back, each time I've started a new blog, it's been during a period of change.
First, I was graduating college and starting my career as a freelance copywriter.
After that I was transitioning away from copywriting and becoming increasingly interested
in science. Next, I was beginning yet another transition - this time into the world
of computer programming and web development.

This time is different, which is why I have a feeling I may actually be able to keep
this promise to myself, that this is the last time I tear down my blog and start
again from square one. This blog doesn't so much mark a transition as it does a sort
of solidification. I am, with close to zero doubt, going to be doing this programming
thing, in one form or another, for the rest of my career.

Now, I could look back and impose some sort of grand narrative that explains exactly
how I got here and why every step along the way makes some sort of sense, but that wouldn't
be an accurate reflection of reality. Rather, I'm going to talk about the reason I felt it
necessary to mark a fresh start.

### Things are not the Way They Used to Be

When I look back, the changes I see as marking the beginning of my adult life began
about two or three years ago, during my senior year of college. I could tally
up an exhaustive list of epiphanies, ideas, opinions, thoughts, etc. but really, all
of the changes that I've gone through can be summarized in two bullet points.

+ I used to shirk personal responsibility for my growth and development as a human being.
+ I used to reason about myself and the world around me in a much less rigorous fashion.

For most of my life I was a rather slapdash thinker, prone to hyperbole, generalizations,
intuitions, and imprecision. Over the course of the past two or three years I have been
transitioning, often painfully, away from what Carl Sagan termed "the demon haunted world."

I have, in other words, begun to live the scientific method.

It's for this simple reason that I felt the need to clean house and start fresh,
as far as this blog is concerned. I look back on what I wrote in the past and it's
almost painful to read. The lazy thinking I employed in the past is not something
I'd like to encourage or share.

This blog won't have a set topic, though science and programming will certainly
appear more often than not. No matter what the topic at hand is, my plan is to
consider everything carefully, critically, and in great depth. There are plenty
of blogs out there with an abysmal signal-to-noise ratio. This will not be one of them.
